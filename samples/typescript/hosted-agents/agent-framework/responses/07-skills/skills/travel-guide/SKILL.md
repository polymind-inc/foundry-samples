# Travel guide skill

Use this skill when the user wants a city travel guide, itinerary, or downloadable PDF trip-planning document.

## Workflow

1. Identify the city or destination from the user's request.
2. Infer the trip length and interests when provided. If the user does not specify them, use a 3-day guide and a balanced mix of culture, food, neighborhoods, views, and practical tips.
3. Run the PDF generator script:
   - skill name: `travel-guide`
   - script name: `scripts/create_travel_guide.mjs`
   - args: a JSON array of string CLI flags and values. Supported flags:
     - `--city <city>`: destination city, required
     - `--days <number>`: number of itinerary days, optional, defaults to `3`
     - `--interests <list>`: comma-separated interests such as `food,art,history,views`, optional
     - `--tone <style>`: guide style such as `family-friendly`, `luxury`, `budget`, or `first-time visitor`, optional
4. After the script returns, tell the user the `$HOME`-based PDF path and briefly summarize the guide.

## Available scripts

## Example script arguments
